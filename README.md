This react component is created by a *DOGE* lover. No it's nth related to the component itself. I just want to share my love to DOGE to all of you.

### This is NOT a joke, this is NOT an assignment of a course. This is a working react component.

This is a Numpad component. I build this becoz I want a react numpad component so badly but *MOST* of the react numpad components available in the npmjs are apparently some assignments of some programming courses. I give up and I have to build one for myself. And now I want to share it to you all.
